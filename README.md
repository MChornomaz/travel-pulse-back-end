This is the back-end for Travel-Pulse project and it is built using Node.js and Express framework, along with several npm packages such as bcryptjs, body-parser, jsonwebtoken. It currently has basic functionality to store data in JSON format and respond to appropriate requests. It supports features like adding, editing, and deleting items from the database, as well as image uploads, registration, and authentication.

Note that this is a relatively raw project, and its main focus was on the client-side functionality. However, it will be further improved and optimized in the future.

You can find the code for the client-side part of the project at https://github.com/MChornomaz/travel-pulse, and the deployed version of the app at https://travel-puls.web.app/.
